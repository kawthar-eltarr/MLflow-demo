# MLflow-demo

MLflow is an open-source platform developed by Databricks to help manage the machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools and utilities to simplify various aspects of the machine learning workflow, from experimentation and development to deployment and production monitoring. MLflow consists of several components:

1. **MLflow Tracking:** Enables tracking of experiments and metrics, allowing data scientists to record and compare parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files across different runs to iterate on and improve models.

2. **MLflow Projects:** Provides a standardized format for packaging and sharing code as reusable projects. It allows data scientists to define dependencies, configurations, and entry points for training and running machine learning code in a reproducible manner.

3. **MLflow Models:** Offers a standardized format for packaging machine learning models for deployment and serving. Models can be easily loaded and used for inference in various deployment environments, such as batch scoring, real-time serving, or edge devices.

4. **MLflow Registry:** Enables collaboration and version control for managing and deploying machine learning models. It provides features for registering, versioning, and managing models, allowing teams to track model lineage, experiment with different versions, and deploy models to production seamlessly.

MLflow supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, including Python, R, and Spark, and can be integrated with various ML libraries and tools. It aims to streamline the machine learning lifecycle by providing a unified platform for experiment tracking, project management, model packaging, and model deployment.
